# top-domains
A repository for maintaining a list of the top domains based on multiple lists

When Alexa (the domain list service, not the smart assistant) went away, it left a void.

Now there are a bunch of lists from places like:

- Cloudflare
- Ahrefs
- Semrush
- OpenDNS (Cisco)
- etc…

…that are providing their own.

But everytime I go to pull a list now, for a project like [Robots Disallowe](https://github.com/danielmiessler/RobotsDisallowed), I end up hunting around, not finding a good one quickly, and generally getting frustrated.

So this repo is going to be a place where I:

1. Store all those other lists in case you want them, and
2. Provide my own unified list that benefits from all of them

So basically if you just download [topdomains.txt](https://danielmiessler.com/), you should be good to go for most things you need. No fuss or muss.
